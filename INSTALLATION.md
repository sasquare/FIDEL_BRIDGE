# Installation Guide

This guide walks through setting up FidelBridge locally from a clean clone.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for the Tailwind CSS build)
- Git

## 1. Clone and enter the project

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd FIDEL_BRIDGE
```

## 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

## 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## 4. Install frontend tooling and build CSS

```bash
npm install     # also self-hosts Alpine.js and the Inter font into app/static
npm run build    # compiles app/static/src/input.css -> app/static/css/output.css
```

Run `npm run watch` in a separate terminal while editing templates if you
want Tailwind to rebuild automatically.

## 5. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set `SECRET_KEY` to a long random string. Never commit `.env`.

## 6. Create the database

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

This creates `instance/fidelbridge.db` with the `users`, `customer_profiles`,
`professional_profiles`, `corporate_profiles`, and `categories` tables.

## 7. Seed the default service categories

```bash
flask seed-categories
```

This populates Electricians, Plumbers, Carpenters, and the other default
categories. It's safe to re-run — it skips categories that already exist.
Professional registration requires at least one category to exist.

## 8. Run the app

```bash
flask run
```

Visit **http://127.0.0.1:5000** — you should see the FidelBridge landing page.

## Verifying the setup

- `flask run` should print `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000` with no errors.
- The landing page should load with the navy/amber brand styling (not
  unstyled HTML — if the page looks unstyled, re-run `npm run build`).
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/css/output.css` should return `200`.
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/does-not-exist` should show the custom 404 page.
- Resizing the browser below ~1024px wide should collapse the nav into a
  hamburger menu that opens/closes on click.
- Visit `/auth/register`, create a Customer account, and confirm you land on
  `/customer/dashboard` with a "Hi, `<name>`" greeting in the nav.
- Log out, then log back in at `/auth/login` — you should return to the same
  dashboard.
- While logged in as a customer, visiting `/professional/dashboard` directly
  should show the 403 page.
- Visit `/browse/categories` — you should see 12 category cards (if empty,
  run `flask seed-categories`).
- Register a Professional account and pick a category; then visit
  `/browse/professionals` and confirm the new professional appears and that
  filtering by category/city/keyword narrows the results.
- Click through to a professional's public profile page
  (`/browse/professionals/<id>`) and confirm it loads.
- As a customer, visit `/customer/profile`, change a field, save, and
  confirm the change persists after a page refresh.
- Register a Professional, then visit `/professional/profile` and check a
  few "Available Days" boxes, save, and confirm they're still checked after
  the page reloads (not just saved — actually re-checked on screen).
- Add a skill at `/professional/skills` and confirm it appears as a chip;
  remove it and confirm it disappears.
- Add a portfolio item with a photo at `/professional/portfolio`, and
  confirm the photo appears both there and on the public profile page.
- Upload a document at `/professional/verification` and confirm it shows
  "Pending"; click "View" and confirm the file downloads/opens.
- Log in as a *different* professional and try to guess another
  professional's verification document URL
  (`/professional/verification/<id>/download`) — it should 404, not serve
  the file.
- Register a Corporate account, and from `/corporate/dashboard`, click each
  of the three "Request a Service" cards (Procurement / Facility Management
  / Janitorial) and confirm the request type is pre-selected on the form.
- Submit a request, confirm it shows "Pending" on `/corporate/requests`,
  and that the status-filter tabs (Pending/In Progress/Completed/Cancelled)
  correctly show/hide it.
- Open the request's detail page and click "Cancel this request" — the
  status should change to "Cancelled" and the cancel option should
  disappear.
- Log in as a *different* corporate account and try to open the first
  corporate's request detail URL directly — it should 404.

## Running tests

```bash
pytest
```

All tests should pass (40 as of Phase 5, across `tests/test_landing_page.py`,
`tests/test_auth.py`, `tests/test_browse.py`, `tests/test_customer.py`,
`tests/test_professional.py`, and `tests/test_corporate.py`).

## Common Errors & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'` | Virtual environment not activated, or dependencies not installed | Activate `venv`, then re-run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` |
| Page loads but looks completely unstyled | `output.css` was never generated | Run `npm install && npm run build` |
| `flask: command not found` | Virtual environment not activated | Activate `venv` first |
| `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` | `instance/` folder missing permissions | Delete `instance/` and restart `flask run` — the app recreates it automatically |
| Changes to Tailwind classes don't show up | CSS wasn't rebuilt | Run `npm run build`, or keep `npm run watch` running while you work |
| `.env` values not taking effect | `.env` not created, or Flask started before it was created | Confirm `.env` exists at the project root and restart `flask run` |
| `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: users` | Migrations were never applied | Run `flask db upgrade` |
| Professional registration form shows no category options / fails validation | Categories were never seeded | Run `flask seed-categories` |
| Registration/login form re-shows with no visible error after submitting | CSRF token expired (session too old, or form left open too long) | Refresh the page and submit again — the form now shows "Your session expired" when this happens |
